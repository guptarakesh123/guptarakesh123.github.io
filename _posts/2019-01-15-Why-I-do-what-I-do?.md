<h3>Why Facebook?</h3>
What good would be a technology if it can't help a community you care about. Working at the Facebook gives me the satisfactions as someone who tried to solve a problem.

I have launched few features and enabled the launch of products that helped millions of people connect to each other. I worked on the Hack/PHP, Javascript, Android, GraphQL and few other technologies to deliver my features.

<h3>What did I do at Salesforce?</h3>
I was an engineer in the database cloud team at Salesforce. I tried automating a series of operations that would otherwise take a lot of time and be prone to human errors.

Building CI/CD pipeline was one such project where I enabled the automated code deployment on servers upon a git push. The CI/CD pipepline was built using jenkins, puppet, and git java api's. I later built an automated web service using Checkmarx static code analyzer tool, to find the common code vulnerabilities such as cross site scripting, sql injection, data leakage, etc.

<h3>Morgan Stanley? Why work in a Bank?</h3>
I worked in their technology and data division. I built many web services - asynchronous (using IBM Websphere Message Queues) and synchronous (using TCP socket listeners).

Most of it was written in Java and deployed on Red Hat Linux, however I also built some of the services using Windows Communication Foundation and hosted them on Windows Server (I think v2012). My work resulted in quicker generation of Balance Sheets and P&L statements for the company, and a very convenient inter-company transactions settlement process.
