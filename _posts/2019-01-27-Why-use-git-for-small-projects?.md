title: Why use git for small projects?

Consider that you are working on some small assignment, probably a homework from a professor. The project only has 2000 lines of code, or maybe even less. So it's okay to just keep it on your local machine and submit it to the professor when done. Simple, isn't it?

Yes, but only if you are 100% sure that you never want to look at it again ever. There are several what-ifs that we missed in the story above.
1) What if your computer crashed
2) You never know which projects grow to become very big
3) Bad memory
4) Changing the machine where you develop
5) Learning the version control right from the beginning

Facebook connects more than 2 billion people every month. I spent a lot of time in the rural India, and have seen elderly's craving to see faces of their nieces and nephews living in cities thousands of miles away. Some people don't even know about floods or drought affecting nearby areas, and some friends never see each other because their careers parted them away.
